OrderUp

User Workflow & Core Features
The application is built around a real-time, collaborative workflow that begins when an order is received and ends with a happy customer.
Feature: Real-Time Order Notifications
The workflow begins the moment an order is placed.
User Story:
As a store associate, I want to receive an immediate notification on my device when a new order is created, so I can act on it without delay.
Requirements:
Push Notifications: The application must send a push notification to all logged-in associates at a specific store location when a new order is received.
Notification Content: The notification should contain the Order ID and source (e.g., "New Fanvista Order #1055 received").
In-App Notification Center: A bell icon or similar UI element will show a list of recent, unread notifications.
Feature: Main Dashboard (Associate View)
This is the home screen for the store associate, designed for quick action.
User Story:
As a store associate, I want a clear, simple dashboard that shows me the orders I need to work on right now, including new unassigned orders and picklists assigned directly to me.
Requirements:
Display: The dashboard will be organized into clear sections:
New Orders: A list of all incoming orders that have not yet been added to a picklist.
My Assigned Picklists: A list of picklists that a manager has assigned specifically to the logged-in user.
Ready for Pickup: A list of orders that have been picked and packed, awaiting customer arrival.
Interactivity:
Associates can select multiple "New Orders" to create a picklist.
Tapping on an assigned picklist takes the user directly to the Picking View.
The associate view does not show a history of past fulfilled orders, keeping the focus on active tasks.
Feature: Picklist Management & Assignment
This feature allows for the efficient batching and delegation of work.
User Stories:
As a store manager, I want to group multiple orders into a single, saved picklist and assign it to a specific associate to ensure clear ownership and accountability.
As a store associate, I want to see a consolidated list of all items I need to pick for my assigned batch, sorted by location, to make my trip through the store as efficient as possible.
Requirements:
Picklist Creation:
Users (manager or associate) can select multiple orders from the "New Orders" list.
The system generates a consolidated list of items.
The picklist is saved with a unique ID and can be managed from the Manager's Console.
User Assignment:
Upon creating a picklist, a user can choose to "Assign to User".
This will open a dialog showing a list of available associates at that store.
Once assigned, the picklist appears in the associate's "My Assigned Picklists" section on their dashboard, and they receive a notification.
Feature: Picking & Packing Workflow
This two-stage process ensures both efficient collection and accurate sorting of items.
Picking View
User Story: As a picker, I want to follow a simple, location-sorted checklist on my device to collect all the items for my assigned batch in one go.
Requirements:
This is the active screen for the picker, showing the consolidated, location-sorted list of all items and total quantities.
Each item has a checkbox or "Pick" button to mark it as collected.
A "Proceed to Packing" button becomes active only when all items are marked as picked.
Packing Screen
User Story: As a packer, after I've gathered all the items in bulk, I need the app to guide me on how to sort these items correctly into their original orders.
Requirements:
After picking is complete, the app transitions to this screen.
It displays the individual orders that were part of the picklist as separate cards or sections.
Each order card shows an itemized list of products and quantities for that specific order.
The user sorts the bulk items into separate bags/bins based on this view.
Each order card has a "Mark as Ready for Pickup" button. Clicking it updates the order's status and removes it from this screen.
Feature: QR Code Fulfillment
This feature creates a fast and error-proof pickup experience for the customer.
User Stories:
As a customer, I want to receive a QR code with my "order is ready" notification so I can have a quick and easy pickup experience at the store.
As a store associate, I want to scan a customer's QR code to instantly pull up their correct order, avoiding the need to ask for names or order numbers.
Requirements:
QR Code Generation: When an order is marked as "Ready for Pickup," the system (fanvista, suitespot etc) generates a unique QR code for the customer.
In-App Scanner: A prominent "Scan QR Code" button on the dashboard opens the device's camera in a scanning mode.
Order Retrieval: A successful scan immediately opens the corresponding Order Detail View.
Final Fulfillment: The associate verifies the order with the customer. A "Complete Hand-off" button on this screen marks the order as Ful...
